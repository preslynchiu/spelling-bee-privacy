        <strong>Summary:</strong> My Spelling Bee Trainer is designed with children's privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or share any personal information. All data stays on your device.
    </div>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My Spelling Bee Trainer ("we," "our," or "the App") is committed to protecting the privacy of our users, especially children. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our iOS application.</p>

    <h2>Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <p>We want to be clear about what we do NOT do:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We do NOT collect personal information</li>
        <li>We do NOT collect names, email addresses, or contact information</li>
        <li>We do NOT track your location</li>
        <li>We do NOT use analytics or tracking services</li>
        <li>We do NOT share any data with third parties</li>
        <li>We do NOT display advertisements</li>
        <li>We do NOT require account creation</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
    <p>The App stores the following data locally on your device only:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Word Lists:</strong> Custom spelling words you add to practice</li>
        <li><strong>Progress Data:</strong> Test scores and learning progress</li>
        <li><strong>App Settings:</strong> Your preferences (speech rate, customizations)</li>
        <li><strong>Purchase Status:</strong> Whether premium features are unlocked</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to us or any third party.</p>

    <h2>Microphone Usage</h2>
    <p>The App may request microphone access for the following purpose:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Speech Recognition:</strong> To allow voice-based spelling input during tests</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Audio is processed locally on your device using Apple's Speech Recognition framework. We do not record, store, or transmit any audio data.</p>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>The App offers a one-time premium upgrade purchase. All payment processing is handled securely by Apple through the App Store. We do not have access to your payment information.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)</h2>
    <p>My Spelling Bee Trainer is designed for use by children under parental supervision. We comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children</li>
        <li>We do not require any personal information to use the App</li>
        <li>Parents can delete all App data by uninstalling the App</li>
        <li>No data is transmitted from the device</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App uses the following Apple services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Apple StoreKit:</strong> For processing in-app purchases (governed by Apple's Privacy Policy)</li>
        <li><strong>Apple Speech Framework:</strong> For on-device speech recognition</li>
        <li><strong>Apple AVFoundation:</strong> For text-to-speech pronunciation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These services operate under Apple's privacy policies and process data locally on your device.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>All data is stored locally on your device using iOS's built-in secure storage mechanisms. Since no data is transmitted over the internet, there is no risk of data interception or server breaches.</p>

    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>To delete all App data, simply uninstall the App from your device. All locally stored data will be permanently removed.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of any material changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.</p>
